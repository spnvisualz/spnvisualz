/*
 * This JavaScript file provides a place to add client‑side interactivity to the website.
 * For now, it simply logs a message to the console once the DOM is fully loaded.
 *
 * In the future, additional features—such as a spinning logo or other animations—
 * can be implemented here. To add a spinning logo, you might target an element
 * by its ID or class and apply CSS transformations or animations using
 * JavaScript or CSS keyframes.
