# My Website

This repository contains the basic structure for a modern, static website. It includes
HTML pages, a stylesheet, and a JavaScript file. The goal of this project is to
provide a clean starting point from which further modifications can be made.

## Structure

- `index.html` – The main landing page with a hero section and a placeholder content section.
- `about.html` – A simple page introducing the site's mission. More content can be added later.
- `contact.html` – A contact form page (non‑functional) where users can enter their information.
- `style.css` – Contains global styles for layout, typography, and form elements.
- `script.js` – A placeholder for client‑side scripts (currently logs a message to the console).
- `assets/images` – Directory reserved for images (e.g., logos, photos).
- `assets/videos` – Directory reserved for videos (e.g., spinning logo animation).

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser to see the home page.
2. Navigate to the other pages via the navigation links.
3. To customize the site, edit the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files as needed. You can
   add images to the `assets/images` folder and videos to the `assets/videos` folder.
4. To implement a spinning logo or other animations, you can update `script.js` or add
   CSS animations to `style.css`.

## Future Enhancements

- **Spinning Logo**: Add a logo file to `assets/images` and implement a rotation
  animation in CSS or JavaScript.
- **Responsive Design**: Enhance the layout to be more responsive across devices.
- **Styling Improvements**: Modify colors, fonts, and spacing to suit your brand.
- **Form Handling**: Hook up the contact form to a backend service or add form
  validation and submission logic.

Feel free to expand this project as needed. This repository is deliberately simple so
that it can be adapted to many different use cases.
